thank you for visiting the 1983 Beirut Bombing Memorialization map

this map is populated with information from:
  the Defense Casualty Analysis System maintained by the Defense Manpower Data Center
and 
  information on where the memorials are located/when they were constructed are from several sources: 
    National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, VA, the Marine Corps Archives (from this the Beirut Papers and the Memorials and Monuments Collection), Beirut Veteran Facebook pages, the Beirut Veterans of America webpage, the Historical Marker             Database, and local and national newspapers
    
there is a LEGEND in the top RIGHT corner
  you may click on and off the layers to see change over time.

  Much thanks to Kenzie Hool for helping me with this map. And special thanks George Mason University faculty & staff
